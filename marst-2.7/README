GNU MARST includes three components:

*  the translator, MARST, which allows translating Algol 60 programs to
   the C programming language;

*  the library, ALGLIB, which contains pre-compiled standard Algol 60
   procedures and additional library routines. This library is used at
   the linking stage.

*  the converter, MACVT, which allows converting Algol 60 programs from
   some other (old) representations to the MARST representation.

The input language of the translator is the hardware representation of
full (i.e. Level 0) Algol 60 as described in the IFIP document:

Modified Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60, The Computer
Journal, v.19, No.4, Nov. 1976, pp.364-79. (This document is an
official standard IFIP document. It is *not* a part of GNU MARST.)

Note that there are some differences between the Revised Report and
the Modified Report since the latter is a result of application of the
following IFIP document to the Revised Report:

R.M.De Morgan, I.D.Hill, and B.A.Wichmann. A Supplement to the ALGOL 60
Revised Report. The Computer Journal, Vol. 19, No. 3, 1976, pp. 276-88.
(This document is an official standard IFIP document. It is *not* part
of GNU MARST.)

The translator and all library routines are written in a basic dialect
of the C programming language known as ANSI C 89 and described in the
following document:

ANSI/ISO 9899-1990 (ANSI X3.159-1989), American National Standard for
Programming Languages - C, 1992. (This document is an official standard
ANSI/ISO document. It is *not* part of GNU MARST.)

The output code produced by the translator is in the same dialect.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.
